## HyperKit: Web3 Infra for SDKs & AI Agents

HyperKit is the open infrastructure platform powering modular, AI‑native dApps across all major L1 and L2 blockchains. Our SDK makes it effortless to build, deploy, and scale DeFi and Web3 applications, while our AI Agent layer automates the entire contract lifecycle from prompt to production.

### Key Features

- **Multi‑Chain SDK**: Unified toolkit for Ethereum, Avalanche, SKALE, Mantle, Solana, and Sui, with seamless deployment, contract management, and cross‑chain bridging.
- **AI‑Native Automation**: HyperAgent orchestrates the entire smart contract lifecycle from natural language prompts to audited, deployed contracts with built‑in LLM support for planning, codegen, and testing.
- **Developer Experience**: CLI, React component library, and opinionated templates for fast onboarding and prototyping.

### Getting Started
- [Hyperkit Labs](https://github.com/Hyperkit-Labs)

### Why HyperKit?

- **Modular & Integrative**: Not just another SDK HyperKit integrates the best of Web3 infra, AI, and modular components in one stack.
- **Network Agnostic**: Works across Ethereum, EVM L2s, and non‑EVM chains with a single API surface.
- **AI‑First**: Leverage HyperAgent to generate, audit, and deploy contracts from simple prompts no manual boilerplate.
